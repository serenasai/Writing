What you are doingThree mistakes:
	* Simply Think about in one sentence: What are your work about？ your position

		* clear statement. I can follow this formula and do this myself too 
		* What contribution I want to make? What position should I be in? What’s my voice?
		* how your work fits into that journal 
	* How this relates to the broad of field.

		* what they gain from reading my work. 
		* stand in relation to other litereture 
		* what is new in your work
		* repeat each part and clearly explain your contribution
		* position your location 
	* Don't over critic your work. Be confidence

Core story telling
	* catch the editor's attention
	* 同领域-交叉领域-外行 如何看待我的工作

Look for the journal:
	* Current editor（social media）
	* 5 paper :look for the abstaract
	* who will you send, who will read ,what you like those authors 
	* getting your own way

The more you do it, the faster you get Choose a conversition 找到你自己的圈子成功对每一个人的定义不一样，如果你无法清晰地勾画出什么叫做事业成功，那你未来的道路是模糊的，也将阻碍你走向成功之路。所以花时间来想一想对你来说成功意味着什么吧！
	* 今天的目标：找到你所在的圈子

		* 你的所思所想会指导你的工作选择，所以最大的挑战是选择属于自己的航道，有意识地开始航行
		* 所以展望一下你最希望加入的知识分子世界，你离他们有多远？你是否正在追求一个让自己感兴趣的圈子？你希望把什么加入自己的学术简历中？
		* 展望未来十年，想象你被邀请去一个论坛，你想被介绍成一位什么样的专家?
		* 一半取决于信念，一半取决于策略。所以为了选择一个正确的学术圈，需要去看看其他研究者都在干什么。
	* 今日作业

		* 看看什么研究者的工作与你的课题相关

			* 你引用最多的人是谁？
			* 列出5个人，分别用2-3句话写出他们工作与你工作的相关性

				1. Albert Fert: open the hot research of spintronics and skyrmion, my so called supervisor 
				2. Klaui: the biggest and most distinguished leader in spintronic and skyrmion area, promote the unconventional application of skyrmion 
				3. Guoqiang Yu： The expert in growing skyrmion thin-film and his paper is very easy to understand
				4. Weisheng Zhao: supervisor and my career template to copy and beyond
				5. Xichao Zhang: the most famouse author in micromagnetic simulation area and cooperates with our group

Selecting a community is part conviction (these are the intellectual issues that are important to me) and part strategy (this is what I need to do in order to be successful in my field). In order to select the right intellectual community, it pays to look at what other scholars in your area are doing. This isn’t so you can simply adopt an identical approach. Instead, you’re considering other scholars’ work and their position in an intellectual community so you can understand the contours of your field.Do This:Take some time to reflect on key questions: What scholars are producing the work that is relevant to your topic and argument? In other words, who are you citing the most? Make a list of the five most relevant scholars. Then, write a short explanation (2-3 sentences) of their work’s relevance to your topic and argument.Barriers to Success:Choose a Location找到你在圈子中的定位
	* 今日作业

		* 找到你应该发表的杂志list

			* 文献调查，找到第一天作业的5个人，找出他们与你研究课题相关的最近发表的2-3篇文章，列出相应的期刊，得到一个期刊名单
			* 找到这份期刊名单中出现最频繁的几个，列出共同点，整理出一篇mini内容分析报告，记录你的发现，

				* 是特定领域期刊还是广泛领域
				* 偏好某些研究方法、发表类似的论文
				* 整理处理

		1. Albert Fert:  
		2. Klaui: 
		3. Guoqiang Yu： 
		4. Weisheng Zhao: 
		5. Geffory Beach: 


Look back at your list of five scholars. Where are those scholars publishing?
Do a citation search and identify the last 2-3 articles each of these scholars have published that are relevant to your topic, and what journals those were published in. You should have a list of journals now. Do particular journals appear frequently? Which ones? What do the journals have in common, if anything?
For instance, they might all be specialty journals rather than general interest. Perhaps the journals privilege a certain research methodology or engage similar literatures. Take some time to conduct a mini content analysis on the articles, and then record your findings.
