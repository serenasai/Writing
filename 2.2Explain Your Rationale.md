# Explain Your Rationale 阐明研究的基本原理

原文：

    Take a minute and reflect on why that cohort you identified in the last step absolutely, 
    positively MUST pay attention to what you have to say.
    You’re making a unique contribution to the literature, 
    but with the intention of broadening the conversation in an existing intellectual community.
    What benefit are you providing for your intellectual community?
    So, start by writing  a *lot* about your rationale, then distill it into a single sentence

    
`今日目标：Today’s Goal: Define your rationale`

## 今日作业
> Write 1-2 paragraphs on your rationale.

Answer these questions in your paragraph:

Why am I doing this work?

Why does my intellectual community need to know this information?…..

What (sub)disciplinary “need” am I meeting with my work? ?

Go back and highlight the most important sentence in the paragraph.
