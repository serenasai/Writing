    “I am an expert in my field and I know what I am doing.”. 
    
    This week, we are going to focus on how to convince other members of this community that you belong there.
    You’ll do this in two ways: by showing what you have in common, but also what you add to the conversation.
    
    As you’re working through the exercises this week, keep this word in mind: BREVITY.Use clear sentence in your first sentence of your abstsract.
    
    This also helps you to establish why you’re a legitimate member of this community. 
    You know the community’s norms and ways of thinking.
