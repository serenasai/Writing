## Three mistakes:

* Simply Think about in one sentence: What are your work about？ your position
* clear statement. I can follow this formula and do this myself too 
* What contribution I want to make? What position should I be in? What’s my voice?	
* how your work fits into that journal 
## How this relates to the broad of field.

* what they gain from reading my work. 
* stand in relation to other litereture 
* what is new in your work
* repeat each part and clearly explain your contribution
* position your location 
	
## Don't over critic your work. Be confidence

## Core story telling
	
* catch the editor's attention
* 同领域-交叉领域-外行 如何看待我的工作
