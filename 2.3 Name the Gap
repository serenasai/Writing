# Name the Gap
原文：
    The deeper we dive into our research, the easier it is to lose track of how we got here. 
    
    Each new and exciting discovery can feel disconnected from the initial instinct to address something that others missed. 
    
    It is important to remember that discoveries actually came about because we started looking in the empty spaces. 
    
    Take a minute to draw or write out the progression of your reading and thinking. Where did you start?
    
    Where have travelled (figuratively)? Where are you now? What former empty space does your work now fill?
    
   * When you name the gap, you’re not only identifying a weakness in the literature. 
   
   You’re also establishing yourself as an expert. You’re claiming that you know enough about this literature that you can both critique it and improve it.
   
   Gap与rational的区别：gap是一个新的东西，别人没有涉足过的；rational则是自己的贡献
