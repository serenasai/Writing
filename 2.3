    The deeper we dive into our research, the easier it is to lose track of how we got here. 
    
    Each new and exciting discovery can feel disconnected from the initial instinct to address something that others missed. 
    
    It is important to remember that discoveries actually came about because we started looking in the empty spaces. 
    
    Take a minute to draw or write out the progression of your reading and thinking. Where did you start?
    
    Where have travelled (figuratively)? Where are you now? What former empty space does your work now fill?
    
   * When you name the gap, you’re not only identifying a weakness in the literature. 
   
   You’re also establishing yourself as an expert. You’re claiming that you know enough about this literature that you can both critique it and improve it.
    
`今日目标：Today’s Goal: Identify your gap`

## 今日作业
> First, make a list of what’s unique about your  work. <br>
Keep this list by your side for the duration of this week’s exercises – you’ll be returning to it. <br>
Now, you’re going to begin process of making an article template. 

Select 4-5 abstracts from the journal you’ve decided on (in your discipline this might be an extract). 
These can be the same abstracts you read last week. 
> Read the abstracts, focusing on the first and last sentences. Identify the following:<br>
How the author indicates what’s new in their argument. Examples might be “this article introduces,” or “I redefine…”<br>
* Look for this structure also: “prior research has done X, but this article does Y.”
* The contribution the author is making (or claiming to make).
* Look at the force the author is using. Pay attention to the verbs. You don’t want to write in the passive voice here!
