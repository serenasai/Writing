# Know the Voice 知道编辑的偏好

原文：

    Editors can favor certain methodologies (or descriptions of those methodologies) or topics. 
    You may discover that one or two styles of writing or presentation are dominant in manuscripts published under their leadership. 
    It’s up to you to discover what’s necessary for you to do in order to convince a journal editor to consider your manuscript.
    To reiterate: editors are gatekeepers. Journals have rules, and editors enforce those rules. 
    In general, editors are looking for reasons to reject articles. Not because they’re mean spirited, but because they’re pressed for time.
    They also don’t want to waste reviewers’ time by sending them articles that don’t have a chance of being published. 
    So don’t take yourself out of the running by making easily avoidable mistakes.
