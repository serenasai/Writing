# Know the Voice 知道编辑的偏好

原文：

    Editors can favor certain methodologies (or descriptions of those methodologies) or topics. 
    You may discover that one or two styles of writing or presentation are dominant in manuscripts published under their leadership. 
    It’s up to you to discover what’s necessary for you to do in order to convince a journal editor to consider your manuscript.
    To reiterate: editors are gatekeepers. Journals have rules, and editors enforce those rules. 
    In general, editors are looking for reasons to reject articles. Not because they’re mean spirited, but because they’re pressed for time.
    They also don’t want to waste reviewers’ time by sending them articles that don’t have a chance of being published. 
    So don’t take yourself out of the running by making easily avoidable mistakes.
    
`今日目标：Today’s Goal: Choose your journal`

## 今日作业
> Once you’ve selected the journal, pick 1-2 articles to use as your model articles. <br>  
You’ll use these articles as a template for writing your draft. <br>  
Here are some criteria you can use to select an article:<br>  
>>The author(s) uses a similar methodology.
>>You like the article. You appreciate the writing style, manner of argumentation, etc.
>>The subject matter in the article is relevant to your research.
>>The article has been well-received in your discipline.
>>The article was published recently and under the current editor, preferably within the last 3 issues (this is non-negotiable).
* Extra Credit: After you’ve completed this process for the first journal on your list, repeat it for a second journal. Everyone needs a backup plan!
  


## 我的作业：
* Nature Electronics xiaoyangLin + Julie
* NSR Nat.commu. 暂时无 review paper model
* additional reading:[How Your Journal Editor Works](https://www.chronicle.com/article/How-Your-Journal-Editor-Works/236911)

** 学到的点：可以询问编辑他们的想法和观点，在你提交论文之前；论文接收以后要感谢编辑！！告诉他你怎么推广你的论文
> What’s even more rare is being thanked for our labors. Were you grateful for some feedback on a piece of work you submitted?<br>
Editors helped get you that feedback and might someday report your gratitude to anonymous reviewers. It’s always OK to offer brief,<br>
gracious thanks to journal editors when it’s warranted. Was your essay published, and do you like how it looks? Thank the editors. <br>
Better yet, help us promote your article and our journal, and then show (or tell) us how you did so. <br>
Read the rest of the contents surrounding yours. Report how happy you are to be in that fine company, and why.
