# Big Picture Problem
原文：
    弄明白你所在的领域包含哪些问题，已解决和未解决，从而搞清楚自己的研究处于什么位置和历史阶段
    Imagine your discipline as a very large painting. Everything that everyone is working on sits within the frame. 
    And while each section stands alone as a piece of craft, it is carefully xx into the complete picture. 
    Separate and yet inextricable. 
    How you place yourself in the scene depends of course on what you are working on, but it also depends on your having the courage to see your contribution as part of the picture in the first place. 
    Note: Even if you want to ADD a whole new section to the painting, it still has to connect to the larger scene.
