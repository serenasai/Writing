# Choose a level 找到你在圈子中的位置

原文：

    The prestige factor is a more qualitative measure than an impact factor, 
    but every discipline has certain journals that are considered the best. 
    This may correlate with the impact factor of the journal, but it’s not always an exact match.
    
    If you look at the CVs of people who are slightly above you in rank — associate professors, full professors, 
    and assistant professors who are further along in the process — their CVs are likely more varied than what you might believe. 
    That’s why it’s so important to really workout YOUR key markers of engagement: 
    Who do I want to be talking to? Who do I find interesting?  
    Who is saying things that really resonate with what I’m saying?
    (Not just because they’re in the top ranked journal in your field, or because they’re in a special section journal of my professional association.)
   
    A special note for junior scholars: As a junior scholar it is also important to think about trajectory in a career — 
    in other words, look ahead while focusing on the task at hand. 
    You may have several articles that you would like to publish from your dissertation, 
    and maybe even a book. The extra step here is to map out not only where you are going to start but why you are going to start there. 
    What is the best fit for not only your first article, but the next articles, too.

赛赛的笔记：

    期刊的综合价值很重要，不光是影响因子，还有受认可度、被引用率等
    在哪里发表论文，要与你的职业生涯一起综合考虑，用长远眼光来衡量。
