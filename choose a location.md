# Choose a location 找到你在圈子中的位置

原文：

    Once you select a community, you’ll want to think about how you position yourself in that community. 
    Take a moment to sketch yourself (perhaps literally) in relation to the scholars you are engaging with. 
    Where is the conversation happening? Are you standing aligned in relation to your key points, pushing ahead, facing off? 
    How will you contribute to it? Are you wanting to do more than contribute? 
    Do you want to challenge or change the direction? 
    What do you have to adjust in your approach to prepare to have the impact you want?

    You can think about different journals as representing different points of view. 
    Some may be general perspectives, representing a wide range of topics. 
    Others might be more specialized points of view, representing a specific set of issues in your intellectual community. 
    As you identify the journals that represent a point of view that resonates with your research, 
    you’ll be taking the first steps to establishing your place in your field.

赛赛的笔记：

    通过阅读大牛的论文和发表的期刊，从而找到自己研究应该发表的期刊。
    只有非常清晰的定位才能帮助你知道你的研究应该做成什么样的档次与水平，以及你的论文定位。
    需要注意的是：不可以眼高手低，也不可以把下限设置得太低。
    这一步是站在巨人的肩膀上来定位自己的位置，非常重要。

`策略：为了选择一个适合自己的位置，需要去看看其他研究者都站在何处`

## 今日作业
* Look back at your list of five scholars. Where are those scholars publishing?
* Do a citation search and identify the last 2-3 articles each of these scholars have published that are relevant to your topic, and what journals those were published in. 
* You should have a list of journals now. Do particular journals appear frequently? Which ones? What do the journals have in common, if anything?
> For instance, they might all be specialty journals rather than general interest. Perhaps the journals privilege a certain research methodology or engage similar literatures. 
* Take some time to conduct a mini content analysis on the articles, and then record your findings.



## 我的作业：
> The journal list
    1. Albert Fert: open the hot research of spintronics and skyrmion, my so called supervisor
        * Nature Materials. 19, 34-42 (2020).
        * Physical Review Applied. 11, 054049 (2019).
    2. Klaui: the biggest and most distinguished leader in spintronic and skyrmion area, promote the unconventional application of skyrmion 
        * Nature Electronics 3 (1), 30-36
        * Nature nanotechnology 14 (7), 658-661
    3. Guoqiang Yu： The expert in growing skyrmion thin-film and his paper is very easy to understand
        * Science Advances 6, eaay1876
        * Physical Review Materials 3, 083801
    4. G Beach: skyrmion 
        * Nature Communications 11 (1), 1-9
        * Physical Review Applied 12 (4), 044031
    5. Xichao Zhang: the most famouse author in micromagnetic simulation area and cooperates with our group
        * Advanced Materials 32 (1), 1904815
        * Physical Review Letters 124 (3), 037202
  
> The mini content analysis:
    * The common points； focus on materials and physics, most are experiments, extremly new or big group/name
    * The reason why they could publish is they have a solid foundation publishing related paper already.
